# IR Specialist â€“ Taxonomic Text Similarity Analysis

This project was completed for **CIND110: Data Organization for Data Analysts** at Toronto Metropolitan University. The objective was to perform text mining and similarity analysis across botanical family descriptions to identify closely related families using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

As an IR (Information Retrieval) Specialist, I analyzed XML-structured botanical data to discover which plant families were most similar to the **Apocynaceae** family. The analysis combined structured data extraction with text preprocessing and document similarity techniques.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques Used

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **R & RStudio** | Main programming environment |
| **XML Parsing** | Extracted family descriptions using BaseX |
| **Text Mining** (`tm`, `textstem`) | Cleaned and lemmatized text data |
| **TF-IDF** | Computed term weighting for similarity analysis |
| **Cosine Similarity** | Quantified closeness between family texts |
| **Visualization** | Plotted top similar families and heatmaps with `ggplot2` |

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Steps

1. **Extracted XML data** using BaseX and imported it into R.
2. **Preprocessed** text: tokenization, lowercasing, punctuation removal, lemmatization.
3. Computed **TF-IDF matrices** for family descriptions.
4. Measured **cosine similarity** against Apocynaceae to find related families.
5. Created **bar charts** and **heatmaps** to visualize top similar families and shared vocabulary.
